			<h2 class="title">Research Interests</h2>
			<p>My past main interests are gravity, cosmology and particle physics as well as field theory. In particular, I concentrated on the alternative gravity theories with the problems of the late-time acceleration, cosmic magnetic fields and extra dimensions. I was a member of the KAmioka GRAvitational wave (KAGRA) experiment and studied the gravitational-wave (GW) physics. Currently I am working on the gravitational physics, quantum anomalies and the physical problems with the applications on machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL).</p>

			<h3>Parity Violation associated with Torsion</h3>
			<p>The torsion effect is always small in the theory that is general relativity with torsion so-call <strong>Einstein-Catan</strong> (EC) theory. It always assume that there is no direct interaction between electromagnetic fields and torsion due to the small magnitude of torsion. In teleparallelism, the important object is torsion that is not <strong>small</strong> as in EC theory, the quantum effect of the indirect interaction will be different that the electromagnetic sector may provide a large parity violation effect.</p>

			<h3>Neutrino Physics</h3>
			<p>Due to the neutrino oscillation, it indicate the new physics that the massive neutrino problem is beyond standard model physics. The popular models are so-call see-saw mechanism models to introduce the heavy particle to achieve the light neutrino. The leptogenesis is used to solve the matter-antimatter problem instead of directly giving the baryogenesis. It is always related to the neutrino mass problem with neutrino <strong>parity violation</strong> problems. The neutrino mass mechanism is still unclear, it associates the undetermined type of neutrino, <strong>Dirac type</strong> and <strong>Majorana type</strong> neutrino. There is much new phenomenology for neutrino physics.</p>

			<h3>Gravitational Waves</h3>
			<p>According to the BICEP2 observation, CMB B-mode polarization spectrum provide the first <strong>indirect</strong> evidence of primordial gravitational waves that also predict an energy scale for new physics. The B-mode polarization will contribute additional interaction of CMB that may give the new effect in cosmology.</p>

			<h3>Quantum Cosmology</h3>
			<p>The quantum cosmology gives the description that the universe create from nothing through the quantum tunneling into the <strong>de Sitter space</strong> before inflationary stage. Following Dirac's <strong>canonical quantization</strong> for gravitational <strong>constrain Hamiltonian</strong>, people have the equation is the <strong>Wheeler-DeWitt equation</strong> for wave functional of the universe. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be regard as a <strong>quantum mechanical problem of the scale factor</strong> in <strong>mini-superspace</strong> and provide a simple toy model for people toward the quantum gravity.</p>

			<h3>Cosmic Magnetic Fields</h3>
			<p>My collaborators and I discuss the model that the electromagnetic fields is <strong>non-minimally coupled</strong> to <strong>teleparallel gravity</strong>. The teleparallel gravity (teleparallelism) is proposed by Einstein in 1928 attempt to unified the electromagnetism and gravity. Teleparallelism is assume that it is <strong>curvature-free</strong> everywhere and the main geometric object is the <strong>torsion fields</strong>. Based on the identity of the curvature-torsion relation, we have the <strong>teleparallel equivalent to GR</strong> (TEGR) theory. From literatures, the non-minimal coupling can <strong>violate</strong> the conformal symmetry of electromagnetic sector. Due to the <strong>conformal symmetry breaking</strong>, it can naturally generate the large-scale magnetic field without <strong>galactic dynamo mechanism</strong> in general relativity. We applied this procedure to studied the non-minimal coupling in teleparallel gravity and it can achieve the large field strength for large-scale magnetic fields.</p>

			<h3>Cosmic Acceleration</h3>
			<p>My collaborators and I have studied \(f(R)/f(T)\) gravity to constrain the cosmological parameters by <strong>Hubble parameter</strong> data, <strong>type Ia supernovae</strong> data, <strong>baryon acoustic oscillation</strong> data and <strong>cosmic microwave background</strong> data. \(f(R)/f(T)\) gravity which is a modified gravity model propose to explain the <strong>cosmic acceleration</strong> problem instead of <strong>cosmilogical constant</strong> phenomenologically. We have focused on Linder's <strong>exponential gravity</strong> and <strong>exponential type</strong> \(f(T)\) theories to studied the cosmic acceleration behaviors.</p>

			<h3>Extra Dimension</h3>
			<p>The extra dimension originally is used to unified the electromagnetism and gravity through gauge principle and assume the extra dimension is compactified into a small scale that cannot be observed, which is so-called <strong>Kaluza-Klein</strong> (KK) theory. The <strong>large extra dimension</strong> theories try to solve the hierarchy problem and introduce the concept of <strong>brane</strong> that the standard model matter fields are localized on inspired by supergravity and superstring theory. In the case of non-factorizable metrics of geometry, the RS-I and RS-II model consider the \(AdS_5\) bulk to solve the hierarchy problem and 4-dimensional gravity on the brane respectively. We consider the braneworld and KK scenarios in teleparallel gravity. In our discussion, the braneworld theory in teleparallelism provide the equivalent point of view of GR of braneworld. For low-energy effective KK theory, it does not generate the effective 4-dimensional Lagrangian of <strong>Brans-Dicke type</strong> model as GR and provide a different cosmic behavior.</p>
